# About Me

I am a Creative Technologist and IT Pro. I have 10yrs of experience in Information Technology. I breathe and sleep tech. I love interactive technology projects. I make things happen. I get things done. I plan to spend my retirement becoming a recognized Ramen chef, teaching tech as a side hustle, and owning a modest clothing boutique for women with curves. I believe in working smarter not harder. I love to code, but I also love the powers and possibilities of the no-code movement. Check out my MakerPad profile.

I have YEARS of digital gardening and quantified self data to share. I'll sort out how to migrate them here soon! 😅

For now,check out my first book note [Don't Unplug](books/dontunplug){: .internal-link} in this here lilium.
