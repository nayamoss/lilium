### Note 1

![/assets/stillhere.jpg]({{page.image}})

I am finally reading the book <a class="external-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Im-Still-Here-Dignity-Whiteness/dp/1524760854">I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness</a>.

In the first 5 minutes of listening to chapter one, you are met with bluntness and realness. The book immediately forces you to step into reality, and for those who are not Black or POC identifying, forced to confront reality and bias.
